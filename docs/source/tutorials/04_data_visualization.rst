Tutorial 4: Data visualization
==============================

.. note::

   The complete code associated with this tutorial is available
   `here <https://github.com/LorenzoPiu/aPriori/blob/main/tutorials/04-data_visualization.py>`_.

This exercise introduces some of the main data-visualization utilities provided by the library.
These tools are designed for rapid inspection of DNS fields and for the generation
of publication-quality, single-figure plots with minimal user input.

The plotting interface intentionally favors simplicity and consistency over full
customizability. As a result, the level of personalization is limited when compared to
general-purpose plotting libraries. The current plotting logic is optimized for the
creation of individual figures, which can subsequently be combined or arranged
during post-processing, rather than for assembling complex figures with multiple
subplots within a single call.

Import modules, download dataset, and define data path
------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Imports and paths definition

   import os
   import aPriori as ap
   import json

   # Comment the following line if you already downloaded the dataset
   ap.download(dataset='h2_lifted')

   # Change this with your path to the data folder if necessary
   directory = os.path.join('.','Lifted_H2_subdomain') 

   # Check the folder with the data exists in your system
   T_path = os.path.join(directory,'data', 'T_K_id000.dat')
   print(f"\nChecking the path \'{T_path}\' is correct...")
   if not os.path.exists(T_path):
      raise ValueError("The path '{T_path}' does not exist in your system. Check to have the correct path to your data folder in the code")
   else:
      print("Folder path OK\n")

Initialize field and plot midplanes
-----------------------------------

.. container:: demo

   .. code-block:: python
      :caption: Instantiate Field3D object and plot midplanes

      DNS_field = ap.Field3D(directory)

      # Visualize the data
      # Default plotting of a variable along the x, y, z midplanes
      DNS_field.plot_z_midplane('YH2O2')
      DNS_field.plot_y_midplane('YH2O2')
      DNS_field.plot_x_midplane('YH2O2')

   .. container:: demo-result

      .. figure:: /_static/figures/fundamentals_and_usage/tutorial_04_fig1.png
         :width: 80%
         :align: center

         Figure 1 - H2O2 mass fraction field on the x, y, and z midplanes.

The plotting utilities contain various input options to personalize the output.
The following code snippet provides an example:

.. container:: demo

   .. code-block:: python
      :caption: Advanced midplane plots settings

      # Advanced settings to plot. We'll consider the z midplane for simplicity
      DNS_field.plot_z_midplane('YH2O2',
                              levels=[1e-6,1e-5,1.5e-5], # isocontour lines
                              vmin=1e-6,                 # minimum temperature to plot
                              title=r'$Y_{H2O2}$',       # figure title
                              linewidth=1,               # isocontour lines thickness
                              transpose=True,            # inverts x and y axes
                              x_name='y [mm]',           # x axis label
                              y_name='x [mm]',           # y axis label
                              colormap='inferno_r',        # change colormap
                              )

Plots in the mixture fraction space
-----------------------------------

The mixture fraction :math:`Z` represents a conserved scalar
that parameterizes the local mixing state between the fuel and oxidizer
streams. By construction, :math:`Z=0` corresponds to pure oxidizer conditions,
while :math:`Z=1` corresponds to pure fuel. Intermediate values identify mixed
states, independently of chemical reactions.

For reacting flows, many thermochemical quantities (e.g., temperature or
species mass fractions) exhibit strong correlations with :math:`Z`. The
scatter representation highlights departures from purely mixing-controlled
behavior, which are associated with chemical heat release, differential
diffusion effects, or local extinction and reignition. Coloring the scatter
points by a reactive marker such as :math:`Y_{OH}` helps identify regions of
high chemical activity in mixture-fraction space.

.. container:: demo

   .. code-block:: python
      :caption: Plots in the mixture fraction space

      # Scatter variables as functions of the mixture fraction z
      # Compute the mixture fraction with the compute_mixture_fraction method
      DNS_field.ox = 'O2'     # Defines the species to consider as oxydizer
      DNS_field.fuel = 'H2'   # Defines the species to consider as fuel
      Y_ox_2=0.233  # Oxygen mass fraction in the oxydizer stream (air)
      Y_f_1=0.65*2/(0.65*2+0.35*28) # Hydrogen mass fraction in the fuel stream
      # (the fuel stream is composed by X_H2=0.65 and X_N2=0.35)

      DNS_field.compute_mixture_fraction(Y_ox_2=Y_ox_2, Y_f_1=Y_f_1, s=2)

      # Scatter plot variables as functions of the mixture fraction Z
      DNS_field.scatter_Z('T', # the variable to plot on the y axis
                        c=DNS_field.YOH.value, # set color of the points
                        y_name='T [K]',

                        )
