.. note::

   The complete code associated with this tutorial is available
   `here <https://github.com/LorenzoPiu/aPriori/blob/main/tutorials/ML_closure_reaction_rates.py>`_.

Learner profile
---------------

This tutorial is aimed at a user who has a solid understanding of 
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for Combustion. A basic understanding of 
machine learning is not required. 

The tutorial could also be beneficial for those who do not have strong competencies 
in CFD but know Data Science; in fact, apart from some computations to extract interesting 
quantities in reacting flows, the basic operations that we are going to perform on the data 
are based on filtering of 3D fields. In case the overall code is too overwhelming at once,
make sure to try the previous tutorials in this documentation.

Dataset description
-------------------

The dataset used in this example is a sub-domain of the DNS dataset presented in 
:cite:p:`Jung2021, yoo2009three`. The configuration corresponds to a turbulent lifted
hydrogen jet flame issuing into a heated air coflow at atmospheric pressure. The DNS is designed
to investigate flame stabilization mechanisms close to the autoignition limit.

A diluted fuel mixture composed of 65\% H\ :sub:`2` and 35\% N\ :sub:`2` (by volume) is injected
from a central slot at an inlet temperature of 400 K. The jet is surrounded on both sides by
coflowing air streams at 850 K. The jet width at the inlet is 2 mm and the corresponding jet
Reynolds number is 8000. Turbulent inflow conditions are imposed by superimposing velocity
fluctuations with an intensity of 10\% of the bulk jet velocity, generated from an auxiliary
homogeneous isotropic turbulence field and prescribed at the inlet using Taylor’s hypothesis.

The full DNS domain comprises
:math:`2000 \times 1600 \times 400` grid points
(:math:`15H \times 20H \times 3H`) with uniform spacing in the streamwise and spanwise directions
and a stretched transverse grid. The simulation is performed using the Sandia DNS solver **S3D**
with a detailed hydrogen–air mechanism consisting of nine species and twenty-one
elementary reactions developed by Li *et al.* :cite:p:`Li2004`.

In this tutorial, only a spatial sub-domain of the original dataset is employed to reduce memory
requirements and improve reproducibility, while retaining the key physical and chemical features
of the lifted flame configuration.

A priori validation methodology
-------------------------------

Favre Filtered species transport equation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES), the transport equation for the
Favre-filtered mass fraction of species :math:`k` reads

.. math::

   \frac{\partial (\bar{\rho}\,\tilde{Y}_k)}{\partial t}
   + \frac{\partial (\bar{\rho}\,\tilde{Y}_k\,\tilde{u}_i)}{\partial x_i}
   =
   - \frac{\partial j^{\mathrm{sgs}}_{k,i}}{\partial x_i}
   + \overline{\dot{\omega}}_k ,

where:

- :math:`\tilde{Y}_k` is the Favre-filtered mass fraction of species :math:`k`,
- :math:`j^{\mathrm{sgs}}_{k,i}` is the subgrid-scale diffusive flux of species :math:`k`,
- :math:`\overline{\dot{\omega}}_k` is the filtered chemical source term.

In this tutorial, we focus on the **closure of the chemical source term**
:math:`\overline{\dot{\omega}}_k`, which represents one of the main challenges
in turbulent combustion modeling.

A priori evaluation of chemical source terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data, chemical source terms can be
computed directly using detailed chemistry (e.g. through Cantera).
Since DNS resolves both transport and chemical processes down to the finest
relevant scales, the resulting reaction rates naturally account for the full
interaction between turbulence and chemistry.

In a priori analysis, these DNS-based reaction rates are considered as
reference values.

In contrast, LES does not have access to this level of detail. Only
filtered quantities—such as temperature, velocity, pressure, and species
mass fractions—are available. To mimic the information accessible in LES,
the DNS fields are therefore **filtered explicitly**.

Starting from these filtered fields, chemical source terms can be recomputed
using the same detailed chemistry models. However, because the filtering
operation removes small-scale fluctuations, the resulting reaction rates
are generally less accurate than those obtained from the original DNS data.
In particular, transport processes are no longer resolved down to the
Kolmogorov scale, and the interaction between turbulence and chemistry is
only partially captured.

The comparison between:

- reaction rates computed from the original DNS fields, and

- reaction rates recomputed from the filtered fields,

forms the basis of the a priori validation framework used to assess
turbulence–chemistry interaction closures.

Step 1: DNS data processing
---------------------------

In this first step, we extract from the DNS dataset all the quantities required
to perform an a priori analysis and to build a data-driven closure model.
The goal is to construct, from the DNS data, both reference quantities and
LES-like quantities obtained by explicit filtering.

Dataset loading and initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We begin by specifying the path to the DNS sub-domain and initializing a
:class:`Field3D` object. If the dataset is not found locally,
it is automatically downloaded.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Imports and DNS data reading

   import os
   import aPriori as ap
   from aPriori.DNS import Field3D

   directory = os.path.join('.', 'Lifted_H2_subdomain')

   T_path = os.path.join(directory, 'data', 'T_K_id000.dat')
   if not os.path.exists(T_path):
       ap.download(dataset='h2_lifted')

   DNS_field = Field3D(directory)

At this stage, the DNS field contains all primitive variables (velocity,
temperature, species mass fractions) resolved down to the smallest scales.

Compute reaction rates on the DNS grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the detailed chemical mechanism associated with the dataset, we compute
the chemical source terms directly on the DNS grid. These reaction rates
naturally account for the full interaction between turbulence and chemistry
and are therefore used as reference values in the a priori analysis.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: DNS reaction rates

   DNS_field.compute_reaction_rates()

The heat release rate (HRR) is computed automatically as part
of this operation.

Filtering the DNS field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To mimic the information available in Large Eddy Simulation (LES), the DNS
field is explicitly Favre-filtered. In this example, a filter width of
:math:`\Delta = 16` grid points is used.

It is important to note that the filtering operation applies to **all**
variables present in the data folder. Since the DNS reaction rates have already
been computed, they are filtered as well, yielding the filtered reference
source terms :math:`\overline{\dot{\omega}}^{DNS}`.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Filtering

   filter_size = 16
   filtered_field = Field3D(DNS_field.filter_favre(filter_size))

Compute reaction rates on the filtered field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from the LES-like filtered quantities (filtered temperature and
species mass fractions), reaction rates are recomputed using the same
detailed chemistry. These rates correspond to a **Laminar Finite Rate (LFR)**
approximation evaluated on filtered fields.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: LES reaction rates

   filtered_field.compute_reaction_rates()

The discrepancy between DNS-filtered and LFR reaction rates highlights the
impact of unresolved turbulence–chemistry interactions.

Compute additional variables of interest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To train a data-driven closure model, additional LES-scale quantities are
required. These are quantities that are often needed for modeling sub-filter
interactions.
In this tutorial, we compute:

- the strain-rate magnitude,
- the residual dissipation rate (Smagorinsky model),
- the residual kinetic energy,
- chemical and mixing time scales.

These quantities characterize the local interaction between turbulence
and chemistry and are commonly used in subgrid-scale modeling.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: LES modeled quantities

   filtered_field.compute_strain_rate(save_tensor=False)
   filtered_field.compute_residual_dissipation_rate(mode='Smag')
   filtered_field.compute_residual_kinetic_energy()

   filtered_field.compute_chemical_timescale(mode='SFR')
   filtered_field.fuel = 'H2'
   filtered_field.ox = 'O2'
   filtered_field.compute_chemical_timescale(mode='Ch')
   filtered_field.compute_mixing_timescale(mode='Kolmo')

At the end of this step, the filtered field contains both LES-resolved variables
and reference subgrid-scale quantities, enabling the construction of
data-driven closure models.

Step 2: Neural network training
-------------------------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This chapter supposes that the reader is already familiar with Neural Networks (NNs) 
and knows how to code using Pytorch. In case you're not familiar with these concepts, 
I strongly suggest you the following sources:

- Steve Brunton's `book <https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/Steven-L-Brunton/dp/1108422098>`__ 'Data Driven Engineering'.
- `This <https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks>`__ video series from 3blue1brown is an insightful and clear explanation.
- Pytorch `documentation <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html>`__ and `tutorials <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html>`__ are a complete source for learning this library.
- The `exercise <https://github.com/burn-research/data-driven-engineering-course2024/blob/main/04_NeuralNetworks/neural_networks_2024_solution.ipynb>`__ of the class of Data-Driven Engineering for the 1st year master's students 
at Université Libre de Bruxelles. This source is less detailed but can provide quick, 
straightforward source of information if you already have a basic understanding of the topic.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

In this second step, a neural network is trained to model the correction factor
:math:`\gamma` that accounts for unresolved turbulence–chemistry interactions.
The approach follows the same conceptual framework used in models such as
EDC and PaSR, where the filtered chemical source term is written as

.. math::

   \overline{\dot{\omega}}_k = \gamma \, \dot{\omega}^{QLFR}_k .

The term :math:`\dot{\omega}^{QLFR}_k` represents the quasi-laminar finite rates (QLFR)
and typically involves the integration of a reactor in time.
Our approach will be based on the laminar finite rates (LFR)

.. math::

   \overline{\dot{\omega}}_k = \gamma \, \dot{\omega}^{LFR}_k .

Here, :math:`\dot{\omega}^{LFR}_k` is the reaction rate of the :math:`k^th` species 
directly computed from filtered quantities, and :math:`\gamma` is a data-driven 
term which represents the cell reacting fracion predicted by the neural network.
Our optimization problem can hence be reduced to the computation of the factor
:math:`\gamma` such that some quantities of interest related to the reaction rates are
optimized with respect to the reference DNS data. In the next steps we will further
highlight this point.

Data preprocessing for PyTorch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We construct the input feature matrix using quantities available at LES scale:
temperature, strain-rate magnitude, and the slowest chemical time scale.
The target output is the DNS heat release rate.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Reshape the data

   import torch
   import torch.nn as nn
   import torch.optim as optim
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   # DATA PROCESSING
   T      = filtered_field.T.reshape_column() # extract the valeue of Temperature from the filtered field and rehape it as a column vector
   S      = filtered_field.S_LES.reshape_column()
   Tau_c  = filtered_field.Tau_c_SFR.reshape_column()

   HRR_LFR = filtered_field.HRR_LFR.reshape_column()
   HRR_DNS = filtered_field.HRR_DNS.reshape_column()

The input variables are normalized and transformed before building the
training matrix.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Data scaling

   T      = (T-np.min(T))/(np.max(T)-np.min(T))
   S      = np.log10(S)
   S      = (S-np.min(S))/(np.max(S) - np.min(S))
   Tau_c  = np.log10(Tau_c)
   Tau_c  = (Tau_c-np.min(Tau_c)) / (np.max(Tau_c)-np.min(Tau_c))

   # Build the training data matrix
   X = np.hstack([T, S, Tau_c])

The dataset is then split into training and testing subsets and converted
to PyTorch tensors.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Train/test split

   # Divide between train and test data
   X_train, X_test, HRR_LFR_train, HRR_LFR_test, HRR_DNS_train, HRR_DNS_test = train_test_split(
      X, HRR_LFR, HRR_DNS, test_size=0.9, random_state=42)

   X_train = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32)
   X_test  = torch.tensor(X_test,  dtype=torch.float32)
   HRR_LFR_train = torch.tensor(HRR_LFR_train, dtype=torch.float32)
   HRR_LFR_test  = torch.tensor(HRR_LFR_test,  dtype=torch.float32)
   HRR_DNS_train = torch.tensor(HRR_DNS_train, dtype=torch.float32)
   HRR_DNS_test  = torch.tensor(HRR_DNS_test,  dtype=torch.float32)


Neural network architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The neural network is implemented as a fully connected feed-forward model
using PyTorch. The architecture consists of multiple hidden layers with
ReLU activation functions.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Neural network definition and instantiation

   # NN class definition
   class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers):
         super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
         self.layers = nn.ModuleList() # initialize the layers list as an empty list using nn.ModuleList()
         self.layers.append(nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)) # Add the first input layer. The layer takes as input <input_size> neurons and gets as output <hidden_size> neurons
         for _ in range(num_layers - 1):
               self.layers.append(nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)) # Add hidden layers
         self.layers.append(nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)) # add output layer

      def forward(self, x):    # Function to perform forward propagation
         for layer in self.layers[:-1]:
               x = torch.relu(layer(x))
         x = self.layers[-1](x)
         return x
      
   # NN architecture
   input_size = 3
   num_layers = 6
   hidden_size = 64
   output_size = 1
   model = NeuralNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers)


Training loop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The neural network is trained by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE)
between the DNS heat release rate and the corrected Laminar Finite Rate (LFR)
prediction

.. math::

   \dot{Q}_{ML} = \gamma \, \dot{Q}_{LFR}.

The loss function and optimizer are first defined:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Loss function and optimizer
   criterion = nn.MSELoss()
   optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())

The optimizer acts on ``model.parameters()``, which contains all learnable
weights and biases of the neural network layers. During training, these
parameters are iteratively updated to minimize the loss function.

To accelerate training, the model and tensors are transferred to the
appropriate computational device. On Apple Silicon machines, the Metal
Performance Shaders (MPS) backend is used if available; otherwise,
the computation falls back to the CPU.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Transfer to GPU

   if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
      device = "mps"
   elif torch.cuda.is_available():
      device = "cuda"
   else:
      device = "cpu"
      
   model = model.to(device)
   X_train = X_train.to(device)
   X_test = X_test.to(device)
   HRR_LFR_train = HRR_LFR_train.to(device)
   HRR_DNS_train = HRR_DNS_train.to(device)
   HRR_LFR_test = HRR_LFR_test.to(device)
   HRR_DNS_test = HRR_DNS_test.to(device)

   # Move the optimizer's state to the same device
   for state in optimizer.state.values():
      for k, v in state.items():
         if isinstance(v, torch.Tensor):
               state[k] = v.to(device)

The training process consists of repeated forward and backward passes over
the dataset for a fixed number of epochs:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Training loop

   num_epochs = 1000
   for epoch in range(num_epochs):

       output = model(X_train)
       loss = criterion(output * HRR_LFR_train, HRR_DNS_train)

       with torch.no_grad():
           output_test = model(X_test)
           loss_test = criterion(output_test * HRR_LFR_test, HRR_DNS_test)

       optimizer.zero_grad()
       loss.backward()
       optimizer.step()

At each epoch:

1. **Forward pass**: the network predicts the correction factor
   :math:`\gamma` for the training inputs.
2. **Loss evaluation**: the corrected LFR heat release rate is compared
   to the DNS reference.
3. **Backward pass**: gradients of the loss with respect to the model
   parameters are computed.
4. **Parameter update**: the Adam optimizer updates the network weights.

The testing loss is computed without gradient tracking (``torch.no_grad()``)
to evaluate eventual overfitting, but it is not used for optimization.

Training and testing losses are stored at each epoch and plotted on a
logarithmic scale to monitor convergence and detect possible overfitting.

   .. code-block:: python
      :caption: Plot loss vs epochs

      plt.plot(train_loss_list, label='Training Loss')

A decreasing and stable testing loss indicates that the network has learned
a consistent mapping between DNS filtered quantities and the subgrid deep learning 
closure :math:`\gamma \cdot \dot{Q}_{LFR}`.

Step 3: Results visualization
-----------------------------

Once trained, the neural network is evaluated on the full dataset.
Parity plots are used to compare the DNS heat release rate with both
the LFR model and the machine-learning-corrected prediction.
